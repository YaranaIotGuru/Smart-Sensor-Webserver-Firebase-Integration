## Overview

The Smart Sensor Webserver project is aimed at providing a comprehensive solution for real-time environmental monitoring. By integrating ESP32 microcontroller, DHT sensors, Firebase cloud storage, and a webserver, this project offers remote access to sensor data through an intuitive web interface.

## Components

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Ensures seamless integration and control of sensors.
- **DHT Sensors**: Provides precise humidity and temperature readings.
- **Firebase**: Facilitates efficient real-time data storage in the cloud.
- **Webserver**: Enables convenient remote monitoring and data visualization.

## Project Structure


## Getting Started

To get started with the Smart Sensor Webserver project, follow these steps:

1. Set up your ESP32 microcontroller and connect the DHT sensors.
2. Upload the `esp32code.ino` sketch to the ESP32 board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Configure Firebase and obtain the necessary credentials.
4. Update the Firebase configuration in the Arduino sketch.
5. Upload the `index.htm` and `style.css` files to your web server or hosting service.
6. Access the web interface to monitor real-time sensor data remotely.

For detailed instructions, refer to the tutorial videos linked above.
